                    Design View is generally long for discussion based on a single topic designed to inform viewers of different aspects of an industry. Generally we discuss the game industry but will often side on the side of design (hence the name) and talk about things more as a developer/professional as to either describe different perspectives, routes, ect. Game Analysis also falls under this series which will take the in-depth mechanics of a game for discussion.
