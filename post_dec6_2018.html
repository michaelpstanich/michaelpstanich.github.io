                Here for another weekly update! (ignore the fact that it's like, not Wednesday.. I tried alright!) This week we had a focus on getting some work done on upcoming videos and mod updates, more info below.

                <p>For releases this week we had the all-to-lovely Tumblr events going on right now...</p>

                <p>To summarize, Tumblr is disabling adult content because they're too lazy to moderate illegal content. I go more in-depth in the video. A Review for Dead Cells also went up, but apparently no one cared to watch it so... whatever. Here's a link...</p>

                <p>Got some emulation stuff working for future content, specifically toward gaming (as you'd expect with the words "emulator stuff"). This along with some "Top 5" Style videos including my Top 5 games of 2018. Last year it took me a full month to get the video done and I almost always miss the end of the year so this time I'm starting quite early. Script is fully written and I have a decent amount of footage, sadly this also means I have no hard drive space left (which will be relevant in another section X.x). Also we finally broke 600 Subscribers on YouTube! congratulations Us! We'll eventually break that 1k barrier and start actually flowing again, but until then just got to keep grinding it through and trying our best to make it without much promo...</p>

                <p>Decided to actually get an update out for Succubus Heart this week, and also did some work on Lucrative Augments. Both are developing smoothly however it's just time consuming for a lot of stuff, so work has been slow. This means putting a day aside to just hammer things out can get a lot of progress done, especially since I don't like making large overhauls over a long period of time. Succubus Heart 4.5 is  now available (download in the Gaming section of michaelpstanich.com or in the usual places). Here's the changelog for this update...</p>

                Didn't do too much this week, tried to do some sketching but I was in a bit of a slouch this week in regards to drawing, so I mostly worked on some writing. I've been finishing up some connections between characters and getting the proper order-of-events, the story (at this point) looks like it'll have 9 total chapters, with around 3 sub-story style missions per-chapter that all relate to the main story line. Of course there'll be more than that by final release, but these are the stories I'm focusing on for alpha, and will add more missions in later into development (tho I'll be adding in some bounty style missions to create a repeatable gameplay loop and make the game even possible, since it won't be intended as a linear-style experience). Some sketches below, some new, some old. (none have been on the blog tho, so there ya go.)
