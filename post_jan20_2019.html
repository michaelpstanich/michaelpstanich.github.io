        A 2018 Reflection (+ 2019 Changes)
    </div>
    <div class="bdate">January 20, 2019</div>
    <div class="btext">
        <p>And here we are, in 2019, me being 'fashionably' late to another blog post, but whatever! It's time to get down to some refection of 2018 and talk about changes I'll be making in 2019! Some of these changes were already made (I don't reserve things just for the new year) but I'll be going over everything here as a good note to start the year. Of course if you want a video version I did a lot of talking in a VLog, so you can check that out if you want! (It'll cover a bit more YouTube related stuff than this blog post does, while this text version will cover more game-dev and modding stuff)</p>

        <p>So how did my 2018 go? Meh, not well actually, but whatever. I had a lot of things that just didn't go right this year and every time I felt like I was really getting up I would just get shot back down. This kind of let to me getting de-motivated in a lot of ways, but I want to change that! It's been a bit of a struggle with just so many things happening in 2018, but my goal from this year is to stress out less about things, while I'm known to be pretty chill I admit even I got worked up over a lot of stuff in 2018 that I shouldn't have worried about. So, in terms of work, I'm just removing deadlines on personal projects and I want to do a lot more stuff that's "just because I want to" and take time to enjoy life just as I usually do. In the end, I'm a better person here at the end of 2018 than I was at the start, and I think that's the most important part about it all. Sure, I lost some friends, made mistakes, and have a few new scars, but the past should remind us, not define us. For the future it's all about improving who I am and just trying to be happy (and hopefully making others happy in the process)!</p>

        <p>The biggest release since the last blog post was, of course, my Top 5 Games of 2018! I put a lot of work in on this one (and was the initial launch of the new branding/animations) so please check it out and let me know what you think!</p>

        <p>Don't have many sketches to show this time, spent a lot of time on branding and new video templates/animations. And I have a few sketches which I'm saving to show for the AkiBushi announcement. I also lost a sketch file somewhere, afraid I may have deleted it when clearing some old files so I started the Aergia sketch over (that's why the orange bit looks so pixely...) which isn't all that bad, I was doing a vector style I wasn't a huge fan of so this time it'll be painted like my other works (and vectorized later for icons).</p>

        <p>You can also check out this exclusive Snippet from when my sis wanted to join for a let's play! It never got finished (we were cut short) so it wont release officially, but you can check it out here if ya' want.</p>

        <p>In terms of YouTube 2018 wasn't the 'worst' for me, and while I may have not had as much of a raw increase in subscribers as 2017, 2018 was only slightly below and had a lot more relevant stats increasing. More viewership, better average view times, people watching to the end and leaving (mostly) positive comments, and my favorite part, more interactivity! More people were hitting me up on Discord and chatting with me on twitter and the like. It was actually really cool to hear from everyone and was really motivating! So thank you to everyone who's been watching, and hopefully I can exceed any expectations in 2019!</p>
        <p>The first obvious change for 2019 is the new branding and thumbnails. I explain this more in the VLog video but basically I'm removing the side-bars and going with a new 'frame' design. I want to focus a bit more on readability from the 'suggested' section of YouTube and make them look better on social platforms like Twitter and such. This means clearer text, backgrounds that pop a bit more, and of course some more creative edits. I'm also changing my outro to be snappier to help get better retention to the end of the video, I have a habbit of talking too much during the outro but the new method should mean no-one missing relevant info, because with the old method people just clicked off as soon as the end-slate showed up, which is bad for business really. (in-short I'm shortening up the outro and only showing the end-slate at the last 20 seconds so people will be more likely to stay)</p>
        <p>New Content - For Fun Content, SNIPPETs, ect. I may potentially try some Top 5 videos as well, but mostly new content I know I'll be doing just includes some fun types of videos, stuff that's just fun to make and edit. This'll include some skits, heavily edited let's plays, and SNIPPETs. SNIPPETs will be like highlights, either taken from in-production stuff, Let's Plays, Streams, whatever.</p>
        <p>Content that will be Staying (mostly) the same - Impressions Reviews, Checkin' Out, Overviews, Topic/Vlog, Let's Plays. I feel like for these I've nailed down the style I want for them and will keep doing them just like before. I 'want' to do more Checkin' Out and Topic videos. In 2018 I was kinda tired of all the drama in the gaming news so I really just ignored most of it and that meant I didn't do as many topics as I wanted to, but that'll change this year, so expect to hear me talking about these things more often! For let's plays (and streams) I want to try and get more collabs going since I abandoned it for 2018, but I really do enjoy them, so why not?</p>
        <p>Changing Content includes - Design View, Live Streams. I want to 'try' and do more Streams, while my schedule will most likely make this difficult, it'll be a goal! (that probably won't happen X.x) As for Design View, I'll still have the old style of video in the works (in-depth design oriented discussion and explanation). However, I also want to start doing more Tutorial and Short Desciption style stuff, cannibalizing my "The Hacking" series and Tutorial series. I really didn't try to make any in 2018, but people really did request quite a few more and really like the ones I've done, so I'ma give it a shot and put it into the Design View format!</p>
        <p>Content that's Canceled - The Hacking, The Broken Chatbox Podcast. The Hacking only saw one release, while the hack itself got a lot of traction the video was kind of pointless after a certain point and I don't feel I did it well. Now it's going to be put into the Design View series and shortened to just explaining how to use it and how the hack works and leave out all the fluff. The Podcast will just be canceled until further notice. This time around I ran into the same issue as before where I just couldn't get people to show up and there's not point running it solo when I could just do that style of content in my other formats. Podcast will return when I have a schedule and people to show up for it, but honestly I think it'll stay on the back burner for quite a while...</p>

        Modding / Hacks
    </div>
    <div class="btext">
        <p>While I do have some updates in the works (Succubus Heart has a balance update coming, and Lucrative Augments is getting some big improvements) I didn't get a release this month for anything. Plans won't change much for mods/hacks, but I do want to try releasing more of them in 2019. I've made countless hacks that are either used privately or shared through friends or a singular forum or 2, but I want to make more of them public here on the website (and potentially add them to Design View). Some mods are still seeing slowed development (Succubus Heart) but I really can't see myself abandoning the projects... as they say, art is never finished.</p>

        Game Development ( Crystal Grimoire : Heart of Eternity / AkiBushi )
    </div>
    <div class="btext">
        <p>Honestly slacked on this in December/January so not too much to report here. I am, however, going to be working on these projects more and more and also reviving a concept for a game called AkiBushi! AkiBushi will be getting a prototype and I'll be (hopefully) explaining the game and its mechanics in a future blog post, and I plan to release the prototype to the public this time around! I want to try and use AkiBushi to talk around about building a 'real' team, the last time I tried to build a team was in 2016... so maybe now it'll be better? I don't know... either way, I'll still be developing Crystal Grimoire : Heart of Eternity solo either way! (and AkiBushi depending on how the prototype goes)</p>
        <p>Mechanics for Crystal Grimoire : Heart of Eternity are nailed down and the framework is making good progress. All I really have to do now is get those pesky 3D models finished... definately going to be doing some place-holder stuff for the initial alpha release, but I'm looking forward to it! I want to release with at least Eliza (one of the playable characters) fully 'clothed and animated' to show off the art direction and how I plan to use the characters (which may take a bit longer than desired).</p>
