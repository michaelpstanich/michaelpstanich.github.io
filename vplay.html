                    These are Let's Plays, pretty common in the video space for games. Here we play through games, usually with a guest, and just have fun through the experience. The games chosen can be anything from completely blind playthroughs to more advanced strategic and planned out walkthroughs, all depends on who's there and how we're feeling!
