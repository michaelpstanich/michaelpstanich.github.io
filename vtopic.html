                    In our Discussion style videos, which are usually titled Topic Videos unless they are part of the more advanced Deign View or VLog series, are videos where we simply discuss different topics. While most revolve around gaming this is generally an open series where anything can be discussed with the goal of either educating, opening viewer perspectives, or just to simply share. On occasion guests may join for discussions if they're relevant to the topic.
