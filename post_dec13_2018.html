    <div class="btitle">Chill with some Musynx</div>

                <p>Is Thursday the official day now? Sure, sure, now it is. (until I fail to update on-time again and move it to Friday...) Anyways, here with another weekly update/blog thing. This week I took it pretty chill and didn't do all that much revolving 'presentable materials' so this week'll be a short one. No sketches this week either since photoshop decided to stop recognizing my drawing tablet for whatever reason, the fix was simple (just had to edit some config files) but since I was taking it chill I didn't fix it for a few days.</p>
                <p>Oh, nearly forgot, I also released an update to the Website with a new way to load blog posts and some other small tweaks. This change was mostly for me and usability but it's still worth noting.</p>

                <p>A new review released this week, this time for Musynx's Steam Release!</p>
                <iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5hI4exGgdvY" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                <p>I decided to pick it up (wasn't too expensive for the base game) and enjoyed it enough that I ended up doing a full review when I was initially just going to do a Checkin' Out video. It's pretty good and worth a watch!</p>
<div class="bcode">Recent Releases :

                <p>I have a few other reviews in-the-works, but starting to think I started too many video projects at once (which isn't un-like me...). Anyways, going to try and do more Checkin' Out style stuff to get through the backlog of review keys and requests, so expect more of those in the coming months.</p>

                <p>Not much to report here, got some basic stuff organized for Lucrative augments but that's the extent of my own work. Interesting enough however a user over at LoversLab has decided to back-port Succubus Heart SSE into SLE, so if you're interested in that - <a href="https://www.loverslab.com/topic/38187-succubus-heart/?page=25&tab=comments#comment-2458984">here's a link (Thanks Skyrimfloo!)</a> - They also made a small mod for Succubus Heart that adds additional edits, so if you use SuH, check it out!</p>
