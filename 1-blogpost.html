        Happy 2018! (what do you mean I'm late? I'm just fashionable!)

        So I moved again, which is why I was away for the last month... but in that process I have set-up all new plans which I detailed in my latest VLog Video : <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5P4_gdHITA">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y5P4_gdHITA</a>.

        But this is a text post, so here's the outline in text. From this point on I'm going to be trying to merge all of my content to be more centralized and cross over a lot more, this includes my YouTube work, Game Modding/Hacks, Artwork and Game Dev scene. My name is already on most of my mods/hacks so it's not like it's not available, however there's very little crossover.
    </div>
    <div class="btext">
        To solve this I'll be starting a new video series akin to tutorials which cover the making of Mod/Hacks and how they're done. Patreon will be getting more regular posts which will also link through our Discord server, The Broken Chatbox ( https://discord.gg/v9cbQrx ) that will let everyone know what I'm up to and  double as a quick update-place since I change things quite often. I just have to keep up with it... I'm also going to be trying to do more collabs, Evann the Tank has already agreed to join me on some adventures, more on that later in the post...

        Stuff that wasn't mentioned in the VLog video however, I'm also updating some of my branding and patterns. Nothing major but I want to move to using more colors and implement more 'rainbow' style ribbons, this is a continuation of my Logo edit about 6 months ago which added color. I have a website redesign in the works however my site host has proven to be unreliable for php use so I'm looking into new Javascript-ran blog tech. Once the site redesign is done it'll act as a link-hub and show everything I'm working on blog-style with a new look. And now back to the regular updates....

        Future wise me and my good friend Evan the Tank have started recording a Let's Play for doki Doki Literature Club, which should be pretty good although it is a let's play (not the analytical style stuff I normally produce). This week I should have the first of the new mod series covering 60fps patching for PSP games (Specifically Phantasy Star Portable 2 - US Release) up and going to test the format, which Resolution Hex Hacks pretty close as well. I'm also building a back-log of non-time specific videos, mostly in the VLog and Design view series with a few checkin' outs here and there. I want to really try and hit that consistent release schedule, even tho I'll most likely fail again X.x.

        Modding/Hacks aside from those I'm doing videos for have been put on hold for 2 weeks while I build a video backlog and figure out future plans. Did get my Skyrim back up and running however, so there will be updates to those mods afterward (Succubus Heart and a new mod called "DOM - Death Override Mode").

        Game Development

    <div class="btext">
        Development on Crystal Grimoire : Heart of the Goddess (Final Name!) will be on hold for the next 2 weeks while I build a video backlog. After this period I'll be releasing sketch pages on a weekly basis with some outlines. Playable alpha should be out this year, but no promises (a lot can happen in a year X.x)
