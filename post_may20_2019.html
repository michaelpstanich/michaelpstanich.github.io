        Yuumi is FREAKING ADORABLE!<br>
        (League of Legends Rant Included)

        <p>I said I'd probably fail to keep the blog up-to-date and, well, I was right! (I know me so well =^.^=) so I'm going to be mixing up the blog a bit and adding a bit more 'personal flavor' and actually start doing the "I write about topics no one cares about on my blog" kind of... thing. So of course we'll have the usual stuff (updates/art/ect - I even have new weekly news videos releasing on YouTube, so check those out too!) but today I also want to talk about Yuumi's Release in League of Legends! (This'll go well...) Get ready for a long post - it's been a while. Oh, and almost forgot to mention, along with this blog post is a new site update, I removed my old Resume and now have Games and Mods/Hacks separated into their own sections, I also updated the Javascript for navigation (so let's hope things don't break X.x). More content will be added in the future.</p>

        So let's talk about League of Legend's Flying Cat! (Yuumi)<br>
        [ A Character Destroyed by "Toxicity" ] 
    </div>
    <div class="btext">
        <p>I should probably start by saying I actually like her quite a lot, and NOT JUST BECAUSE SHE'S A CAT! But rather, because her mechanics are fairly interesting, as a huge fan of enchanter-style supports (Sona/Nami/Lulu) I was bound to like this one given Riot's history, but she's actually one of my favorites. The reason for this is fairly simple, she's all about positioning and observing the situation rather than being some sort of brute force. This does however lead to her biggest downfall...</p>
        <p>Yuumi can't do anything alone, and the community has branded her as "useless."</p>
        <p>Now, to be fair she can still make plays similar to a good Sona or Janna when alone, but it's so much more exaggerated those any other champ in the game. However, let me explain Yuumi for those that don't actually know yet (or simply don't play League of Legends). All characters have some sort of role in League, each with their own skill sets and unique mechanics. Yuumi's special mechanic is that instead of moving on the field by herself she "attaches" to other characters and helps by amplifying their damage, giving heals/shields/speed buffs, and she even has some offensive skills she can cast herself while still attached and invulnerable! Sounds cool right? Lots of stuff in there, and given support items she has a huge toolkit, but all those tools are about helping others, and what makes "Yuumi can't do anything alone" such a prevalent sentence is that she has next to nothing "for herself."</p>
        <p>And this is where League of Legends notoriously toxic community comes into play. Yuumi requires 100% cooperation from team mates to work in every aspect of her kit. Need to get somewhere? Attach to someone who's headed there for speed boosts, need to get out of a fight? Attach to someone on the outer ring. Need to slow someone that's chasing you? Attach to someone so you can empower your attack skill and slow them! But if no one's there you're.. well, dead. This also works for helping people as well, if they don't work with you and position properly you can't jump between people and do your job, making the champ look useless because people refuse to help you help them! This lead to Yuumi having under a 30% win-rate near launch and created a toxic nature where people started to troll anyone that picked Yuumi, only extending the issues. The second a teammate gives up you lose not only a person on the team but a vital part of Yuumi's kit is also lost. In Bot-Lane (where Yuumi is suppose to be supporting another player) it is even worse, where if you're carry isn't doing well, Yuumi has no tools to make it any better, and it's a lost lane.</p>
        <p>Her kit is so powerful when used properly - even if she's a bit under-tuned at the moment, she has massive play potential. But with a toxic community this champ is almost completely destroyed, I've played 20 Yuumi Games as of the writing of this post, and 16 of them I had a marksman (carry I was supporting) either AFK or outright say I was useless and begin trolling. Sounds a bit like a self-fulfilling prophecy, don't you think? And that's not including the huge number of games people rage in champ select because I pick/declare Yuumi or the number of times my team intentionally banned her and so I just HAD to go Ezreal support (it worked, so don't judge!).</p>
        <p>So hey, Yuumi is pretty cool, but maybe Riot should have done more to fix the toxicity of the game first... But then again, since the CEO's are dry humping their employees, I doubt that'll happen any time soon.</p>

        Personal Works / Releases

    <div class="btext">
        <p>In all honesty, I really haven't been releasing all the much content over the last few months. I've been working on a lot of projects behind the scenes, but not much is really 'showable' at this stage with a lot of my time being put toward programming, writing, and planning. Videos have also been super slow, although I DID start live streaming again! We even finished all of Resident Evil HD, it was a fun experience..</p>
        <iframe width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qFsAKUDkHrM" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>Sketching these last few months have been a bit of a drag, because my drawing tablet's pen broke. Thankfully tho just the other day I was able to 'sorta' fix it! Whenever I would apply any pressure the pen would just stop working, and occationally would just stop half-way, making it pretty useless. Turns out one of the buttons was messed up inside and it was shorting the pen out, removing the button and a spring that had misplaced itself fixed it. Of course now I have one less button but it's better than having no pen!</p>
        <p>It's been quite a while since I've posted so I could really go on forever about everything I've been working on, but for now I'll just show a few things from all over the place. Sketching has been slow, since without my drawing tablet I was a bit limited, but I did play around with some Pixel Art and took a lot of time 3D modeling for game projects. Given that I started streaming again I did some minor branding for that, and of course I took some time to work on Crystal Grimoire : Heart of Eternity's UI design a bit as I move to some new systems and a new prototype.</p>

        Video Content ( YouTube / Twitch )
    </div>
    <div class="btext">
        <p>I've been pretty slow when it comes to working on video stuff lately. I guess it's a bit of a combination of burn-out and just enjoying other projects at the moment. With all the drama that's been happening with YouTube, and all the set-backs I've run into over the last couple months I just haven't been feeling motivated to work on the same type of content I use to. That said tho, I still really enjoy making videos when I actually do get to do so, and I have some stuff I'm working on such as a new Design View, but other things have just taken priority for now. Twitch streams have been fun to try out for a while tho, and I want to get back onto a consistent schedule but it may not happen for a while. I have started up a new weekly news segment type video tho, and I think I'll try to keep that going, at least until I get get individual topic videos going again.</p>

        Succubus Heart (Skyrim Mod)
    </div>
    <div class="btext">
        <p>I started development on 5.0 quite a while ago, and it's been making some pretty good progress. I've moved to a new update structure where unstable "DEV" releases are being made available between large updates, unlike before where I
    'd release a 'mostly' stable version. This does mean more issues are present in the latest public release, but it helps me pinpoint issues and gives people a preview of stuff coming up. The only negative is that the new big update (5.0) will only release for Skyrim Special Edition, as SLE(vanilla) support has been dropped.</p>
        <p>I'll make a more detailed post when 5.0 actually releases in full, in the mean time if you would like to check it out it's downloadable in the usual places (Here at michaelpstanich.com under Mods). Update 5.0 revamps the entire pets system that allows any non-unique NPC to be a pet and has much quicker progression. Crafting has been replaced by a new Soul Forge mechanic, Blood Chips (a new item) is used to create items from memory. Passives have been rebalanced with much simpler progression, and of course more passives are being added for different play styles. Even more interestingly tho, I've completely changed how a lot of the backend works which drastically reduces the memory and registry hit (along with making a few things quicker and less error prone). It's a pretty big update as far as Succubus Heart goes, so I'm pretty excited to get it released! (It's pretty close to an early release)</p>

        [Project] Akita
    </div>
    <div class="btext">
        <p>I know I mentioned I was working on a rhythm game, and after quite a lot of prototyping, it's official! Currently code named "[Project] Akita", Akita is a Rhythm / Visual Novel / RPG hybrid that combines the story elements expected of a multi-path VN, the progression and character building (as well as choice making) of an RPG, with the frantic and fun gameplay of a lane-based rhythm game! The current prototype is probably where I'll move into Alpha and start making an actually functioning game.</p>
       Sample Screen Shot showing the current visuals for [Project] Akita PROTO-5
        <div class="bimage"><img src="blog/Akita_WIPproto5_displaysample.png" /></div>
        <p>[Project] Akita will have 3 different sections of play...<br>
        - Play point 1 will be the actual Rhythm Game itself. This will be initially pretty similar to other lane-based Rhythm games (think Guitar Hero, BeatMania, or more recently Musynx) but with a few things to mix these mechanics up with elements inspired by more free-form/specific input type games (Think Sound Vortex, Groove Coaster, Mai Mai).<br>
        - Play point 2 will be the RPG elements. Here you have a character and a full story to progress through, you act as a guardian spirit following other characters as you travel across maps, uncovering secrets and solving mysteries! Through doing so you'll improve various stats that help with progression, switch up the Rhythm Game aspect, and unlock new dialogue and areas.<br>
        - Play point 3 is the Visual Novel / Story aspect. When reaching points on different maps or triggering events characters will talk and interact with each other. During these segments the player will be able to make choices  that will determine future characteristics of each character, such as how they treat you or how they react to other things you say.</p>
        <p>I'll have a more complete post when I make a public release (I plan to release a very early alpha/prototype release soon[tm]). I've messed around with a lot of different mechanics, figuring out target platforms, writing story/lore, and of course actually building the prototypes. Currently our target platform is PC with android coming at a later date, keyboard or a multi-touch screen will be required to play.</p>

        Crystal Grimoire : Heart of Eternity
    </div>
    <div class="btext">
        <p>I won't talk to long about this for now, I've been working on a new version of the game almost completely from scratch after a lot of feedback on mechanics and some huge shifts in gameplay after (what I considered) a failed prototype. We're still going turn-based but now there will be multiple characters at once to command similar to other games, and skills are being simplified with the main focus shifting to combo-ing commands from characters to get various effects. I'm also introducing a new "class wheel" system. Production wise I've been working a lot on 3D modeling and working on programming the new abilities/stats system (creating a new custom and dynamic effects/status system that will make things much easier to manage and 'super smooth'). I'm also working on refining the UI to be cleaner and less intrusive, and to accommodate the new mechanics. With my drawing tablet pen broken I didn't get too much 'showable' work done, since it's all base level stuff, but there should be more in the future. (Note : You can see some of the new cleaned UI look in this post's sketch-board above)</p>
